          <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
			<p>Like most website operators, Py Networking collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
                referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Py Networking's purpose in collecting
                non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Py Networking's visitors use its
                website. From time to time, Py Networking may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>Py Networking also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.pynetworking.com blog posts.
                Py Networking only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that
                it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>


<h2>Reservation of Rights</h2>
	<p>We reserve the right at any time and in its sole discretion to request that you remove all links or any particular
	link to our Web site. You agree to immediately remove all links to our Web site upon such request. We also
	reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions and its linking policy at any time. By continuing
	to link to our Web site, you agree to be bound to and abide by these linking terms and conditions.</p>
<h2>Removal of links from our website</h2>
	<p>If you find any link on our Web site or any linked web site objectionable for any reason, you may contact
	us about this. We will consider requests to remove links but will have no obligation to do so or to respond
	directly to you.</p>
	<p>Whilst we endeavour to ensure that the information on this website is correct, we do not warrant its completeness
	or accuracy; nor do we commit to ensuring that the website remains available or that the material on the
	website is kept up to date.</p>

          <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
			<p>Py Networking discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
                to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
                information in order to process it on Py Networking's behalf or to provide services available at
                Py Networking's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
                employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country;
                by using Py Networking's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Py Networking
                will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
                anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
                Py Networking discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Py Networking
                believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
                of Py Networking, third parties or the public at large.</p>
			<p>If you are a registered user of http://www.pynetworking.com and have supplied your email address,
                Py Networking may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
                or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Py Networking and our products. We primarily use
                our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
                If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we
                reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
                support other users. Py Networking takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
                unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                personally-identifying information.</p>
